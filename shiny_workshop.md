## R Shiny: What? Why?

"Shiny makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R. Automatic "reactive" binding between inputs and outputs and extensive prebuilt widgets make it possible to build beautiful, responsive, and powerful applications with minimal effort." &mdash; from the Shiny documentation

You can use these apps in many ways, including to share research and increase its impact and accessibility, to explore data yourself, and as a teaching tool.

Today we will learn to make a simple app, will cover some key functions from the Shiny library, and will explore the concept of reactivity in R Shiny; understanding reactivity will allow you to create and control the kind of interactive experience your app enables.

Some examples:

## Install the R shiny package

`install.packages("shiny")`

------

## Structure of a Shiny App (server and ui)

```
library(shiny)

ui <- ... # Determine appearance and layout of the app

server <- ... # Specify the code the server needs to run, e.g. to draw plots and process data

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

We'll use the `ui` object to create the appearance information that goes to the browser - layout, html elements, widgets to display, placement of plots and tables.

We'll use the `server` object to specify the work the server needs to do to make the app run, processing the data, doing calculations, and building plots and tables.

------

## A basic template and empty app:

```
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
    # Determine appearance and layout of the app
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    # Specify the code the server needs to run, e.g. to draw plots and process data
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
If you run this app and view in a browser, you can see that R has created html for the page. You can also see that it is using the Bootstrap framework for the interface.


------
## Layout, panels, and html

Example #1 - The setup here includes: `titlePanel`, `SidebarLayout` with `sidebarPanel` and `mainPanel` (and `position` parameter).

Example #2 - We can create HTML with the R Shiny functions `h1`, `h2`, etc., and the `tags` named list:`tags$h1`, `tags$h2`, `tags$a(href="www.rstudio.com", "R studio site")`,  etc. 

For more tags, see the full [tag glossary](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html).

There are other functions for making panels in your page, and they are worth exploring and using. You can see all the UI Layout functions in the Shiny [function reference](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.4.0/).

Example #3a - Includes: `wellPanel`, `tabsetPanel`, `tabPanel` (note that the `tabsetPanel` has the `tabPanels` within it).

We can also change the whole structure of our page by switching from `fluidPage` to `navbarPage`. A `navbarPage` has several `tabPanels` inside it, each of which has a title that goes at the top of the screen, and its own content (including panels within each tabPanel, if you like).

Example #3b - `navbarPage` instead of `fluidPage`, with `tabPanel`s and a `navbarMenu` within the `navbarPage`. Each `tabPanel` can have its own content and panels within it. This example also includes an image (Note: if using an image src that is not external, put the image in a folder called `www` within your app folder. The precise name `www` is important. Shiny will share files in `www` with the user's browser.)

You can read more on layouts <a href='https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html'> here </a>.

If you would like to learn more about HTML itself, try this [HTML tutorial from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).


------

## CSS styling and themes

We can add custom CSS by putting a CSS file like `stylesheet.css` in the `www` subdirectory, whose contents are sent to user’s browser, and then including in our ui code something like:

`ui = fluidPage( includeCSS(”stylesheet.css"), ...`

We also can customize the look of our app by using Shiny themes. There are pre-existing themes and you can also customize your own.

You can include a theme by installing the `shinythemes` package and then passing a theme argument to `fluidPage`:

`ui = fluidPage( theme = shinytheme(“darkly”),...`

## Widgets or *Input functions and *Outputs; introduction to creating reactivity and connecting inputs and outputs with *render expressions

Example #4 - First, we add `*Inputs` (widgets) and `*Outputs` to UI, each of which gets an id. These inputs and outputs will be passed to the server function in input and output lists, so we can use them within the server function by using their ids to access them from the input and output named lists (e.g. as `input$myInputId` and `output$myOutputId`). We can use these input and output variables tell server what to do and how to connect inputs and outputs with `render*` functions. The `render*` functions set up reactivity so that **when any one of the inputs that the render function relies on changes, the output and display will change as well**.  

### Widgets/`*Input` functions

|Function |	Widget|
|----------|---------|
actionButton | Action Button
checkboxGroupInput |	A group of check boxes
checkboxInput | A single check box
dateInput	| A calendar to aid date selection
dateRangeInput	|A pair of calendars for selecting a date range
fileInput | A file upload control wizard
helpText	| Help text that can be added to an input form
numericInput	| A field to enter numbers
radioButtons	| A set of radio buttons
selectInput | A box with choices to select from
sliderInput | A slider bar
submitButton	| A submit button
textInput	|A field to enter text

### Output Functions

| Output function |	Creates|
|-----------------|--------|
dataTableOutput |	DataTable
htmlOutput |	raw HTML
imageOutput	| image
plotOutput |	plot
tableOutput |	table
textOutput |	text
uiOutput	| raw HTML
verbatimTextOutput |	text

See input and output options in the Shiny [function reference](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.4.0/).

## You try (exercises):

1. Edit the app in example 4 by adding another slider that works to control the number of samples drawn each time (so that we can adjust and not just draw 100 samples each time we draw the graph). (A solution is shown in `example4-updated.R`, but you should work to complete this exercise yourself before you look at it.)

2. Using the `textInput` function, allow the user to set the title of the graph with their own text. (Ideally, there will still be a default title in place before the user has typed anything).

3. Try making from scratch a Shiny app that looks and works like the example [here](https://karinknudson.shinyapps.io/example5_apptomatch/). You *can* look at the code in `example5_apptomatch/app.R` if you are really stuck, but you will learn best if you struggle with the process some yourself, so don't shortchange yourself by cutting short that struggle too early!

4. If you have extra time, use it to experiment with by using and connecting other `*Input` and `*Output` functions to make your own app, or play with layouts, styles, and themes.

## Questions, comments

## Understanding and controlling reactivity

 **Reactive values** change in response to inputs. Previously, we used `*Input` functions to create reactive values that went into a named list that we called `input`. We use reactive values inside reactive functions, such as `renderPlot`, `renderDataTable`, etc.
The reactive function outputs an **observer**.  Reactive values notify downstream objects that they've changed, and the object created by the reactive function responds. Thus, a `render*` function "knows" to rerun its code when the reactive value(s) it depends on changes.
 When a reactive value changes, it notifies downstream items that it's no longer valid; we call this process "invalidating."

In addition to `renderPlot`, which we saw in previous examples, there are other `render*` functions that make different objects to display. All of these `render*` functions get a block of code as an argument, contained in curly braces. Whenever any reactive value that appears in the `render*` function is invalidated (i.e. changes), the whole code block will be rerun.

### Example 6 - `reactive(), eventReactive()`

`*Input` funtions create reactive values, but perhaps we want to have and use some reactive quantity that's not exactly what an *Input function gives us. We may want to use `reactive()`.

`reactive()` builds a reactive expression using a code block that you pass it as a parameter. We call reactive values like a function (i.e. with parentheses). A reactive expression stores its value in memory, and only reruns its code if it is invalid.

`eventReactive()` is similar but creates and returns a reactive expression that *only responds to the specified reactive value(s)*. So, its arguments are a reactive value(s) and a block of code. You can use these, e.g. to delay reactions.

### Example 7 - `observeEvent, observe()`

This example also includes an interactive data table. We'll use data from an example R dataset, but you could certainly load your own from data. We'll put the code to load the data outside ui and server, since it only needs to run once. When you are making your own app, be sure you are sharing data appropriately, and not sharing data that is private.

`observeEvent()` has a similar structure to `eventReactive()` in that it takes as an argument specified reactive value(s) and a code block that re-runs only if the specified reactive value/expression gets invalidated (doesn't rerun in response to any other reactive values it might contain!). Unlike `eventReactive()` it does not return anything; we simply use it to run a certain block of code.

### `observe()`

`observe()` takes a single block of code as an arguemtn, and reruns itswelf whenever *any* reactive value in the code changes (as `render*` functions do).

### `isolate()`

`isolate()` takes as input an expression that includes reactive values or expressoins, and creates a non-reactive value out of them. We can use isolate, which takes a block of code as input. The block of code could include reactive values, but when these reactive values invalidate, the result of isolate() does not invalidate and thus does not cause the code block around it to re-run. 

### Some other useful functions: `reactiveValues(), reactiveTimer()`

`reactiveValues()` makes a list of reactive values. `reactiveTimer()` creates and returns a reactive value that invalidates after a specified time period - e.g. `timer <- reactiveTimer(3000)` creates a reactive expression `timer` that invalidates every 3000 milliseconds.

## Deploying a Shiny app on the internet

Name your script App.R

Deploy using one of three options:
1. Deploy with shinyapps.io (includes free and paid options. Paid options allow for more apps, active hours, and support from R Studio)
2. Shiny Server - if you want to host shiny apps yourself on a Linux machine that you have access to
3. RStudio Connect - a paid server program with additional features

See more about these options, including a feature comparsion [here](https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/).

-------
## Efficiency notes:

Everything in app.R runs when the app is launched (so you could include one-time data-loading type code, library loads, etc. outside of ui or server).  The server code runs separately for each user, and code inside a render expressions re-runs anytime one of the inputs that appears inside the render expression gets changed.
